# Arrow detection
This project detects black arrows and predict their direction, distance and orientation it two differnt ways:
1) Using Keras neural net to create a model on self develoved data set of arrows
2) Using concepts of Computer Vision with help of OpenCV.

## Neural Network:
* High acccuracy on test set.
* Low accuracy in real world.
* Over-fitted.

## Computer Vision:
* High accuracy in real world environment.
